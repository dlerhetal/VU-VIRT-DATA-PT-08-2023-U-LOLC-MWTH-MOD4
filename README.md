Special Recognition:
I always do participate in various study groups while working on projects with collaborators including but not necessarily limited to the following peers: Forest Prodan, Ilknur Sekmen, Justin Ibeh, Karson Kosek, Kiara Shannon, Luisa Dinwiddie, Margo Berry, Maria Wolfgang, Morgan Escue, Morgan Foge, Nathan Johnson, and William Brewer.

Although I did attend office hours and study groups and always find Andrew Clifft to be a wealth of knowledge, I collaborated extensively with Angela Reed and Josh Gibson for this project, and although I don't typically store the names of the AskBCS Learning Assistants who regularly save the day, I am hopelessly indebted to Dinh who saved the day this time around by redirecting me to pay more attention to the existing format of the starter file. Also, our professor Ahmad Mousa and TA Joshua Steier should never go uncredited. Specifically this week, Ahmad cracked the mystery of why the labels for my bins would not display. (They needed to be called out because they were out of order. Also, help files? Whaaaaa?)
